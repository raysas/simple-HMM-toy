# <i>toy</i> Hidden Markov Model

_HMM implemented from scratch for a simplified 5′ splice-site recognition problem._  
This is my implementation to the problem described in ["What is a hidden Markov model?" by Sean Eddy (2004) published in _Nature biotechnology_](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1004-1315) [1].

## Background

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a probabilistic model that describes a sequence of observable events generated by a sequence of hidden states. It is widely used in bioinformatics for sequence analysis. The _5' splice-site recognition problem_ is a simplified version of the problem of identifying the boundaries of exons and introns in a gene. The problem is to predict the location of the 5' splice site in a sequence of nucleotides.

Starting by defining initial HMM terms for this problem:  
- **Hidden States:** $S=\set {E, 5, I}$  
set of hidden states where $E$ is the exon state, $5$ is the 5' splice site state, and $I$ is the intron state.
- **Observables:** $O=\set {A, C, G, T}$
set of observable states, in this case the nucleotides 
- **Initial probabilities:** $\pi = \set {\pi_E, \pi_5, \pi_I}=\set{1,0,0}$  
Initial probabilities of being in each state starting from the state at $time=0$. In this problem, the nucleotide sequence always starts with an exon; ___note, the sum of all initial probabilities must be 1___
- **Transition probabilities:** $T=\set{t_{Si/Sj}}$
Matrix that contains the probabilities of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$. In this problem, the transition probabilities between the 3 states E, 5, and I should be a $3*3$ matrix as follows: 

<div align="center">

| $t_{Si/Sj}$ | $E$ | $5$ | $I$ |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| $E$      | 0.9 | 0.1 | 0 |  
| $5$      | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| $I$      | 0.1 | 0 | 0.9 |

<!-- <i>note, instead of a 0.1 probability to end after intron, this was edited to have an exon at the end of the sequence</i> -->
</div>

- **Emission probabilities:** $E=\set{e_{(o/s)}}$  
Matrix that contains the probabilities of emitting an observable $o$ from a hidden state $s$. In other words, probability of observing a nucleotide given an exon/intron/5' hidden state. In this problem, the emission probabilities should be a $3*4$ matrix as follows:

<div align="center">

| $e{(o/s)}$ | $A$ | $C$ | $G$ | $T$ |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| $E$        | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| $5$        | 0.05 | 0 | 0.95 | 0 |
| $I$        | 0.4 | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.4 |
